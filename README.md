# False-Data-Injection-Detection-Using-Auto-Regression-Technique
Sensor nodes provide data about different physical processes which is used for information purposes or to drive control systems. False data injection is a major problem faced in these systems which affects the overall efficiency of the system and the authenticity of the data being collected. The state of the art detection algorithms and  using the auto regression technique for this false data injection detection are studied. A test environment in a lab room with a base station in the middle and  nine static z1-nodes at different locations in the room are setup. Detecting false data injection using this technique was successful
